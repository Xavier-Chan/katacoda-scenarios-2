Different team should have different role. For example, the software developement team should have **Administrator** role for developing and maintaining the various wordpress customization.

On the other hand, the sales team should not have such access right. The sales team is responsible for maintaining product/pricing data and creating the marketing/promotion campaigns in the wordpress and WooCommerce platform. The **Shop Manager** role will allow the sale team to do that without granting them access to back-end functionality.
